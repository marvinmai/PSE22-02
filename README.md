# Exercise sheet 2

## Inhalt dieses Übungsblatts
This repository contains all projects for exercise sheet 06.
In the presence part you will take an extensive look on how to use the hamster simulator. 
Furthermore you will learn about objects, their properties and relations to other objects.
Additionally you will create your own hamster instances and you will explore available commands (as well as their edge cases).

In the home part you will prove the skills you learned in the presence part. 
For example you are going to take a theoretical view on objects and work with the hamster simulator again. 
Have fun!
